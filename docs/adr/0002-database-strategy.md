# 0002 - Backend / Database Strategy

## Date: 

May 17, 2025

## Status

**PROPOSED**

## Related ADRs

- 0001-authentication-strategy.md - Database strategy must align with authentication requirements

## Context

The project requires a robust database solution for managing user data, program registrations, and program content for a STEM education platform. The system needs to handle:

- User profiles and authentication data
- Program/event information
- Registration and attendance records
- Document storage references
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Real-time updates
- High concurrency (1000+ users)

Additionally, the system must comply with GDPR requirements and maintain high performance as specified in the non-functional requirements.

## Options

### Option 1: Traditional PostgreSQL Setup

Pros:
- Full control over database setup
- No vendor lock-in
- Lower operational costs
- Direct SQL optimization capabilities

Cons:
- Higher maintenance burden
- Manual scaling configuration needed
- Self-managed security
- Additional development for real-time features

### Option 2: Supabase (Selected Solution)

Pros:
- Built-in real-time capabilities
- Automatic API generation
- Built-in row level security
- Managed scaling and backups
- PostgreSQL compatibility maintained
- Integration with authentication system
- Built-in security features

Cons:
- Vendor lock-in concerns
- Higher operational costs
- Limited control over infrastructure
- Learning curve for team

## Decision

We will use Supabase as our database solution for the following reasons:

1. **Rapid Development**: Auto-generated APIs and real-time subscriptions accelerate development
2. **Security**: Built-in row level security and integration with authentication
3. **Scalability**: Managed scaling aligns with our non-functional requirements
4. **Modern Features**: Real-time updates essential for attendance tracking
5. **Developer Experience**: Strong tooling and documentation

Implementation approach:
1. Set up Supabase project
2. Configure row level security policies
3. Implement database schema with migrations
4. Set up backup and monitoring
5. Configure real-time subscriptions
6. Implement data access patterns

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Faster development velocity
2. Reduced infrastructure maintenance
3. Built-in security features
4. Real-time capabilities out of the box
5. Simplified scaling

### Negative

1. New technology learning curve
2. Increased operational costs
3. Dependency on external service
4. Limited database customization

### Risks to Monitor

1. Service availability and performance
2. Cost scaling with usage
3. Data migration complexity
4. Vendor lock-in impact

### Follow-up Actions

1. Create detailed data model
2. Document security policies
3. Set up monitoring
4. Create backup strategy
5. Train team on Supabase features
