## Date: 

May 17, 2025

## Status

**PROPOSED**

## Related ADRs

- 0001-authentication-strategy.md - Frontend framework must support chosen auth strategy
- 0002-database-strategy.md - Framework must integrate well with Supabase

## Context

The project needs a modern frontend framework for building a responsive, accessible, and performant web application for managing STEM education programs. The solution must support:

- Server-side rendering for performance
- Progressive enhancement
- Type safety
- Rich interactive features
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Fast page loads (<3s requirement)
- Scale to 1000+ concurrent users

## Options

### Option 1: Next.js with Pages Router

Pros:
- Mature and stable
- Large ecosystem
- Simpler learning curve
- Well-documented

Cons:
- Older architecture
- Limited server components
- Less optimal performance
- Being phased out

### Option 2: Remix with App Router (Selected Solution)

Pros:
- Built for performance
- Native TypeScript support
- Modern server components
- Built-in error boundaries
- Enhanced progressive enhancement
- Better data loading patterns
- Strong type safety
- Better streaming support

Cons:
- Steeper learning curve
- Newer patterns to learn
- Smaller ecosystem
- More complex deployment

### Option 3: SvelteKit

Pros:
- Excellent performance
- Simple development
- Small bundle sizes
- Great developer experience

Cons:
- Smaller ecosystem
- Less enterprise adoption
- Limited TypeScript support
- Fewer resources available

### Option 4: Astro.js

Pros:
- Zero-JS by default
- Excellent static site performance
- Flexible component integration
- Multi-framework support
- Strong content focus
- Small bundle sizes

Cons:
- Limited dynamic features
- Newer framework
- Smaller community
- Less suitable for highly interactive apps
- Limited enterprise track record

## Decision

We will use Remix with App Router for the following reasons:

1. **Performance**: Server components and streaming support meet our <3s load time requirement
2. **Type Safety**: Native TypeScript support reduces runtime errors
3. **Modern Architecture**: App Router provides better patterns for complex applications
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Built-in support for accessibility requirements
5. **Data Handling**: Superior data loading patterns for program management

Implementation approach:
1. Set up Remix project with TypeScript
2. Configure App Router structure
3. Implement server components
4. Set up error boundaries
5. Configure CI/CD pipeline
6. Implement monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Better performance out of the box
2. Improved type safety
3. Better progressive enhancement
4. More maintainable code
5. Future-proof architecture

### Negative

1. Learning curve for team
2. More complex deployment
3. Need to establish new patterns
4. Initial development slowdown

### Risks to Monitor

1. Team adaptation to new patterns
2. Build performance
3. Development velocity
4. Third-party library compatibility

### Follow-up Actions

1. Create development standards
2. Set up performance monitoring
3. Document best practices
4. Plan team training
5. Create component library
