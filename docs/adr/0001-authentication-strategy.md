# 0001 - Backend / Authentication Strategy

## Date: 

May 17, 2025

## Status

**APPROVED**

## Related ADRs

None - This is the first ADR.

## Context

The project requires a secure and scalable authentication system for managing different user roles (admin and basic) in a STEM education platform. The current implementation uses session-based authentication with PostgreSQL for user management, but the project requirements indicate a move towards Clerk for authentication as mentioned in the README.md and instructions.md.

Key considerations:
- Need to support multiple user roles (admin, basic)
- Must handle secure password storage
- Requires session management
- Must be scalable for future growth
- Must comply with security and GDPR requirements as specified in instructions.md

## Options

### Option 1: Session-Based Authentication

Pros:
- Already implemented and working
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Direct control over user data
- Integrated with existing PostgreSQL database

Cons:
- Session management overhead
- Scaling challenges with distributed systems
- Manual security implementation required
- More maintenance responsibility

### Option 2: Clerk Authentication (Proposed Solution)

Pros:
- Built-in security best practices
- Simplified user management
- Multi-tenant support out of the box
- Built-in compliance features
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Better scalability
- Modern authentication features (MFA, social logins)

Cons:
- Third-party dependency
- Migration effort required
- Additional cost
- Less direct control over user data

## Decision

We will migrate from the current session-based authentication to Clerk for the following reasons:

1. **Security**: Clerk provides built-in security features and best practices
2. **Scalability**: Better supports the non-functional requirement of 1000+ concurrent users
3. **Compliance**: Helps meet GDPR and security audit requirements
4. **Maintenance**: Reduces the maintenance burden on the development team
5. **Features**: Provides modern authentication features out of the box

Implementation plan:
1. Set up Clerk integration
2. Migrate existing user data
3. Update authentication middleware
4. Update frontend components
5. Test thoroughly
6. Phase rollout to production

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Improved security posture
2. Reduced maintenance burden
3. Easier scaling
4. More authentication features available
5. Better compliance handling

### Negative

1. Migration effort required
2. Learning curve for team
3. New dependency in the system
4. Ongoing cost for Clerk service

### Risks to Monitor

1. Data migration complexity
2. Service availability dependency
3. User experience during transition
4. Integration with existing PostgreSQL user data

### Follow-up Actions

1. Create detailed migration plan
2. Set up monitoring for Clerk service
3. Update documentation
4. Train team on Clerk
5. Create rollback plan
